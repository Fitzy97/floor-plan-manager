# floor-plan-manager
Floor plan layout manager with login and floor plan studio
# Usage
Run X file to view the app in your browser at localhost:3000
Once you've created an account and logged in, try creating a floor plan in Creator page.  It will ask you to fill out the general specifications of the floor plan.
After submitting the requirements, the system will generate a floor plan and save it to your account. (NOTE save + create new and save + return to List view)  You can then see it in the List page. 
This page will house all of your past floor plans, and you can click on any plan to view it.  See the individual rooms and the location of each door.
# Future features
I'd like to implement multi-floor floor plans that show the user how multiple floors fit together.
Also,

NOTES
- Application theme (color? light blue?) 
- Need Java 17 to mvn clean install
